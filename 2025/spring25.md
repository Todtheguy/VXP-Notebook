## Week 1 <a name="week1"></a>

### Meeting Notes

- Went over the syllabus and timeline for the semester
- Subteams were discussed
- Will be joining Inverse Spectra subteam

### Tasks 
- [x]  Fill in signup sheet
- [x]  Read Syllabus and Slides
- [x]  Set up PACE ICE and VSCode environment 

## Week 2 <a name="week2"></a>

### Meeting Notes

- Recap of Timeline
- Subteam annnounced
- PACE ICE down for maintainence Jan 13-16
- Went over basics of Inverse Spectra problem (XRD, Rietveld Refinement, Materials Project) (See Slides)
### Main Point 
- Simulation of XRD Spectra is exceptionally computationally expensive, using existing methods (eg. Reverse Monte Carlo)
- Use Active Learning to figure out crystal structure based on existing XRD Spectra
- Crystal Structure represented as graphs with nodes as specific atoms and edges as bonds 
  - Fit must be close
  - Better than existing methods (Beat the Reverse Monte Carlo) 
Surrogate model takes over the work of running multiple simulations

Possible goals
Conditional Diffusion to replace existing packages
Building surrogate model


### Tasks 
- [x]  Meet with team before 1/27

## Week 3 <a name="week3"></a>
- Monday was MLK Jr Day (no meeting)
  

### Meeting Notes

01/24
- Group meeting 3:15PM Friday recurring 
- Stephen is group leader
- Established plan to gather research papers on inverse problems
- Shared DiffCSP and ActiveStructOp Github Repos
- Briefly shared what was worked on last semester (fixing version issues between DiffCSP and ActiveStructOp)
  
### Tasks 
- [ ]  Ask Ian for his draft research paper
- [ ]  Read DiffCSP paper
- [ ]  Read over slack chat


## Week 4 <a name="week4"></a>

### Meeting Notes
- Continued presentation on ActiveStructOp
- Recap of last semeser's work using DiffCSP
- ActiveStructOp outperforms reverse Monte Carlo

New ideas:
**Project 1**
-Replace GNN with conditional DIffCSP as surrogate model
-Update DiffCSP values

**Project 2**
-Instead of random weights, use MatterTune (pre-trained GNN)
